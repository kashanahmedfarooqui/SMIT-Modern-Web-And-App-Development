    What is Coding?

Coding is essentially instructing a computer to perform specific actions by turning its internal switches on or off [00:00]. It involves giving a set of instructions to the computer.

The speaker uses an analogy of asking someone to make tea: you give an input (request for tea), there's a processing stage (making the tea), and you receive an output (the tea) [00:43]. Similarly, coding is giving instructions through a language that the computer understands.

How Computers Understand Instructions

Computers don't understand human languages directly [01:41]. They understand binary language, which consists of zeros and ones (0s and 1s).

This is because computers are made up of many switches, each having two states: on or off [01:58]. An off state is represented by 0, and an on state by 1 [02:12].

Binary numbers can represent other numbers; for example, two switches can represent four numbers (00, 01, 10, 11) [02:33].

Why Programmers Don't Write in Binary

Writing programs directly in binary (machine language) would be extremely difficult and time-consuming for humans [03:35].

Therefore, programming languages and compilers are used [03:49]. Programmers write code in a higher-level programming language, and a compiler converts this code into binary (0s and 1s) that the computer can execute [03:55].

Beyond Syntax: The Importance of Logic Building

Coding isn't just about learning syntax (the rules of a programming language) [04:26]. It also heavily involves logic building [04:32].

Logic building is about deciding how to give instructions to the computer efficiently. For instance, there might be multiple ways to solve a problem, and a good programmer chooses the most efficient approach to save computation time [04:49].">
